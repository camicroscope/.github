# caMicroscope Code of Conduct

As a member of the caMicroscope community, it's essential that we maintain a welcoming and respectful environment for everyone involved. We want our community to be inclusive and diverse, and to achieve that, we have established the following Code of Conduct that we expect all community members to adhere to:

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we, as contributors and maintainers, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected Behavior

We expect all community members to:
- Be respectful of other community members.
- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Be considerate of different points of view and experiences.
- Show empathy towards other community members.
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism.

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- Using harassing or offensive language.
- Posting, sharing, or displaying inappropriate content.
- Insulting or derogatory comments or personal attacks.
- Public or private harassment.
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior will not be tolerated within the caMicroscope community. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action deemed appropriate, including warning the offender, temporary or permanent suspension from the community, or any other actions that protect the well-being of the community.

## Reporting Violations

If you experience or witness behavior that violates our Code of Conduct, please report it to our project maintainers at [camicroscope-leadership@googlegroups.com](mailto:camicroscope-leadership@googlegroups.com). All reports will be handled with confidentiality and will be taken seriously. We are committed to maintaining the confidentiality and privacy of those who report violations.

Our Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).
